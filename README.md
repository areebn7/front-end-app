# Customer Management System

## Overview

The Customer Management System is a full-stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This application allows users to manage customer records by adding, updating, and deleting entries. It features a user-friendly interface with a React frontend and an Express backend connected to a MongoDB database.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
